# Lab Summary

In this course track, the following topics were taught.

# What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing refers to virtualized services, such as servers, databases, and other resources, all made available through the internet ("the cloud").

## Cloud Models
- **Public:** Various services and APIs are available to anyone willing and able to pay.
- **Private:** Offers the same capabilities as the public cloud, but the infrastructure and services are only available to the organization that owns them.
- **Hybrid:** In this model, the company can use resources from both the public cloud and its private services.
- **Multicloud:** Involves using multiple clouds, such as combining AWS with Azure, among others.

*Note: Multicloud is mentioned but is not part of the AZ-900 certification exam.*

# Difference Between CapEx and OpEx
- **CapEx:** This is the initial expenditure for cloud implementation, which tends to decrease over time as it represents the investment cost in purchasing hardware and infrastructure.
- **OpEx:** Ongoing expenses related to consumed services and APIs. The cost is determined by the amount of usage, meaning you pay as you use.

# Benefits of the Cloud
- **High Availability:** The ability to keep services running even in case of failures, compensating for downtime with credits as per the SLA (Service Level Agreement).
- **Scalability:** The ability to increase or decrease computing resources based on demand, either automatically or manually. Vertical scalability, such as adding more CPUs or RAM, allows you to pay only for what you use.
- **Elasticity:** In case of a sudden increase in demand, resources can be scaled up either automatically or manually. You can configure the environment to request more resources based on demand or predefined metrics. Elasticity often refers to horizontal scalability, i.e., adding more server instances.
- **Reliability:** Thanks to its decentralized design, the cloud allows deploying resources in multiple regions. Even if there are issues in one region, others continue to operate, ensuring high reliability.
- **Predictability:** The cloud allows predicting both performance and costs, adjusting them as needed to meet business requirements.
- **Security:** The cloud provides various security tools to prevent attacks and damage. While the cloud provider offers infrastructure security, many implementations and configurations are the client's responsibility.
- **Governance:** Automated audits that flag resources out of corporate compliance standards. It also provides mitigation strategies, monitors resource usage, and ensures compliance with security and privacy regulations.
- **Manageability:** The cloud offers various tools for resource management, such as APIs, PowerShell, and portal interfaces, providing flexibility in managing cloud infrastructure.

# Types of Azure Cloud Services
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):** The cloud provides digital infrastructure, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. In this model, the client manages the operating system, applications, and has more control over the environment.
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service):** The cloud provides a complete development environment where developers can build and deploy applications without managing the underlying infrastructure, facilitating agile development.
- **SaaS (Software as a Service):** Allows the use of software hosted in the cloud, accessed via the internet. The provider is responsible for maintenance, infrastructure, updates, and security.
